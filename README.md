# Demand Categorisation for Improved Forecasting in Perishable Food Supply Chains

This repository contains the dataset used in the paper:  
**"Demand Categorisation for Improved Forecasting in Perishable Food Supply Chains"**

## Description

The paper explores the impact of demand categorization on forecasting accuracy within perishable food supply chains. Using demand categorisation and applying tailored forecasting models, the study demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy and decision-making for supply chain optimization.

The dataset provided here supports the experiments and findings presented in the paper.

## Dataset

The dataset is stored in the file **`dataset.csv`**. It includes time-series data for the demand of 189 articles, with each column representing an article. The first column contains the dates.

The dataset is clean and ready to use for forecasting experiments and other analytical tasks.
